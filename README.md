Based on the Ticket types Provided by BVG questions are asked and got response from  the user and based on the user response suggestions are given to the user in a popup.
In this application Have used Functional and Class Components based on the functionality.
Since the technical stack allowed to use is only Reactjs, HTML, CSS not used any third part libraries, means bootstarp or other plugins like react-select etc are not used.
Implemented the Application only with reactjs without using Redux store, and only by rendering the components.
Folder structure followed is, based on the functionality and usage components are placed in respective folders.
Common Folder:Components that are reused are placed inside common folder.
Home: Main component where all the components are rendered.
And Home component is rendered inside app.js
